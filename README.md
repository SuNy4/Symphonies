***TL;DR:*** We delve into a novel query-based paradigm for SSC that not only aims to enhance performance, but also ensures compatibility with large vision models as encoders and accommodating the requirements of modern query-based multi-task autonomous driving systems. Our approach achieves 12 mIoU & 37.7 IoU on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.

This project is built upon ***[TmPL](https://github.com/npurson/tmpl)***, a template for rapid & flexible DL development with [Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) & [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

## Installation

1. Install PyTorch and Torchvision referring to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
2. Install MMDetection referring to https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html#installation.
3. Install the rest of the requirements with pip.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Training**

    ```shell
    python tools/train.py [--config-name config[.yaml]] [trainer.devices=4] \
        [+data_root=$DATA_ROOT] [+label_root=$LABEL_ROOT] [+depth_root=$DEPTH_ROOT]
    ```

    * Override the default config file with `--config-name`.
    * You can also override any value in the loaded config from the command line, refer to the following for more infomation.
        * https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/your_first_app/config_file/
        * https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/hydra-command-line-flags/
        * https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/

2. **Generating outputs**

    ```shell
    python tools/generate_outputs.py [--config-name config[.yaml]] [+model.ckpt_path=/path/to/ckpt]
    ```
